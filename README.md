# Color Picker
This color picker allows you to mix colors using RGBA and converts it to HEX and Binary RGB

### What is RGBA
RGBA stands for red green blue alpha. Red, green, and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors, supplemented with a fourth alpha channel. Alpha indicates how opaque each pixel is and allows an image to be combined over others

### How to use
Increment, decrement or write a number between 0-255 for the color channels and the background will change accordingly. Below you can see the HEX code of the color, as well as the binary representation of each color.
